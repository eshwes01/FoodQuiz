### Functional Testing

Functional testing is a critical process in the software development lifecycle aimed at verifying that each feature of the website operates in conformance with the required specifications. This type of testing focuses on the user interface, APIs, databases, security, client/server applications, and overall functionality of the website. By systematically assessing each component, functional testing ensures that all aspects of the website, such as navigation links, forms, search features, and interactive elements, work correctly and deliver the expected results. The primary goal is to identify any discrepancies or defects in the application's functionality, thereby ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience. Functional testing is typically carried out using both manual testing and automated tools to cover a wide range of scenarios and use cases.
