## 8. Future Features

 ### 1.   "Notification If Any Unanswered Question", this feature has missed out as of time limit better to add in the next sprint.
 ### 2.   User should only see the Quiz Start button at the start of the page. First question would appear only when user click start .

 ### 3. Few known bugs to fix in the next sprint

      a)  Quiz Start Button should perform as reset button however session doesn't clear fully and user can still see the saved answers.This should be fix as it can confuse to the user.

      b)  Mobile size device responsive layout needed to be fixed as it has to be more compact and reducing space to attract user with more important element.
